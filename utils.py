# CMU 18-794 Homework 4
# The code base is based on the great work from CSC 321, U Toronto
# https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc321_2018/assignments/a4-code.zip
# CSC 321, Assignment 4
#
# This file contains the models used for both parts of the assignment:
#
#   - DCGenerator        --> Used in the vanilla GAN in Part 1
#   - DCDiscriminator    --> Used in both the vanilla GAN in Part 1
# For the assignment, you are asked to create the architectures of these
# three networks by filling in the __init__ and forward methods in the
# DCGenerator, DCDiscriminator classes.
# Feel free to add and try your own models
